Positions of game elements need to be independent of pixels positions. This will simplify both rendering code and game update code. Game elements are positioned using a scale of 1.0 (game position) == 1 cell (rendering). 1 rendering cell is driven by the variable CELL_SIZE.

Example:
// Creep is within cell (1, 0)
CELL_SIZE = 25; // pixels
// game positions (in game units)
creepX = 1.5;
creepY = 0.5;
// rendering positions (in pixels)
creepRenderX = 37.5; // creepX * CELL_SIZE
creepRenderY = 12.5; // creepY * CELL_SIZE
